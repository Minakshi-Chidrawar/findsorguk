A repository for the current generation of the Portable Antiquities Scheme Website. A British Museum project that 
encourages the voluntary recording of archaeological artefacts found by the public in England and Wales. A working 
version of this software can be seen at [https://finds.org.uk](https://finds.org.uk) or at [https://marinefinds.org.uk](https://marinefinds.org.uk) 
and comprehensive instructions about how to install a copy can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/findsorguk/findsorguk/wiki).

## Requirements
The database is written with a Linux operating system in mind. 

### Operating system requirements:
* Recommended Ubuntu 16.04 or other LTS 
* PHP 5.4+
* SOLR 4.2
* MySQL 5.7
* APC Cache or equivalent
* Curl
* ImageMagick
* GD
* PDO

### PHP libraries
Most of the PHP libaries are included as submodules, which will be pulled on deployment via Git on your server.

* Zend Framework 1.12.21dev
* Solarium 2
* ZendX_JQuery
* HTMLPurifier
* EasyBib
* mpdf
* imagecow

### Geographical boundaries
The system also makes use of converted OS boundary data in geoJSON format (also included as a submodule.) These are also maintained in a [Github repository](https://github.com/findsorguk/findsorguk-geodata).

## Search index
You will also need to install and configure SOLR for the system to be fully functioning. The schemas for this are 
located in our [SOLR repo](https://github.com/findsorguk/findsorguk-solr).

## Virtual host configuration
A set of example [virtual host](https://github.com/findsorguk/vhostsConfigs) configuration files for Apache 2.4 are available. 

## SSL 
It is recommended that the system is configured to use https and the free service offered by Letsencrypt is ideal.

## Contributing 
We welcome code contributions to make this system better. Please refer to our [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines before submitting patches or new features.

## Changes
A [change log](CHANGELOG.md) is now maintained by the project developers to try and explain how things are being improved.
